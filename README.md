# DotHeader
A "pixel like" header design

Step001: Create a matrix of "dots" that will in a wrapper of any dimension.
Step002: Add some variety or non-uniformity to the "dots" so it's not a sheet of one single color.
Step003: I want the display to feel more active and be obvious that the user can interact with it. So, I'm going to simulate random pixels being clicked which hopefully triggers the css hover sudo property, setting the opacity to 1.0 temporarily.
